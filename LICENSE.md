Ultimately, your work is your own. This license is designed to protect against jerks trying to make money off someone else's work. Any exemptions not listed here require permission from the code author.

###Damages
This license prohibits any attempt to hold the author liable for damages caused by usage of the the code or compiled binaries. Bugs happen, so make backups, and don't complain if your world gets corrupted. Seriously, make backups.

###Reserved Rights
I reserve the right to change this license at any time, although chances are I won't, because legalese annoys me.

Conclusion
====
Ultimately, don't be a jerk, play nice, be polite, and you'll be fine.
